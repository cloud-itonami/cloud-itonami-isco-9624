  "WaterFirewoodActor — the ISCO-08 9624 water-and-firewood-collection-
  site scheduling/logistics coordination actor as a
  `langgraph.graph/state-graph` (ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md Actors
  section). One graph run = one site-coordination operation request
  (intake -> advise -> govern -> decide -> commit/hold, with a
  human-approval interrupt for escalated proposals). No infinite
  internal loop; checkpointed per superstep so an interrupted run can
  resume after human sign-off. Modeled closely on
  cloud-itonami-isco-9212's livestockfarm.actor for the outdoor-manual-
  labour hazard-domain shape, extended with a second, independent
  water-source/terrain hazard-scope dimension.

  ```text
  :intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit            (:ok? true)
                                             +-> :request-approval   (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                             +-> :hold               (:hard? true)
  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the Water and Firewood Collector Advisor
  can never directly commit an operating record the WaterFirewoodGovernor
  refuses, and can never make this actor finalize a collection-work-
  execution decision (e.g. finalizing the collection operation) or a
  site-safety-clearance decision (e.g. declaring a water source safe for
  collection), and can never override a site safety supervisor's
  judgment — every commit-record! call is gated behind `:decide`, and
  both scope-excluded decision classes are a permanent hard block
  regardless of disposition path. This actor coordinates SITE
  SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS ONLY — it never performs collection work itself
  and never makes a site-safety-clearance decision itself."
